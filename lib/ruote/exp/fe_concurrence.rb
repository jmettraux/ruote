require 'ruote/exp/merge'


module Ruote::Exp

  #
  # The 'concurrence' expression applies its child branches in parallel
  # (well it makes a best effort to make them run in parallel).
  #
  #   concurrence do
  #     alpha
  #     bravo
  #   end
  #
  # == attributes
  #
  # The concurrence expression takes a number of attributes that allow for
  # sophisticated control (especially at merge time).
  #
  # === :count
  #
  #   concurrence :count => 1 do
  #     alpha
  #     bravo
  #   end
  #
  # in that example, the concurrence will terminate as soon as 1 (count) of
  # the branches replies. The other branch will get cancelled.
  #
  # === :remaining
  #
  # As said for :count, the remaining branches get cancelled. By setting
  # :remaining to :forget (or 'forget'), the remaining branches will continue
  # their execution, forgotten.
  #
  #   concurrence :count => 1, :remaining => :forget do
  #     alpha
  #     bravo
  #   end
  #
  # === :merge
  #
  # By default, the workitems override each others. By default, the first
  # workitem to reply will win.
  #
  #   sequence do
  #     concurrence do
  #       alpha
  #       bravo
  #     end
  #     charly
  #   end
  #
  # In that example, if 'alpha' replied first, the workitem that reaches
  # 'charly' once 'bravo' replied will have the payload as seen/modified by
  # 'alpha'.
  #
  # The :merge attribute determines which branch wins the merge.
  #
  # * first (default)
  # * last
  # * highest
  # * lowest
  #
  # highest and lowest refer to the position in the list of branch. It's useful
  # to set a fixed winner.
  #
  #   concurrence :merge => :highest do
  #     alpha
  #     bravo
  #   end
  #
  # makes sure that alpha's version of the workitem wins.
  #
  # === :merge_type
  #
  # ==== :override
  #
  # By default, the merge type is set to 'override', which means that the
  # 'winning' workitem's payload supplants all other workitems' payloads.
  #
  # ==== :mix
  #
  # Setting :merge_type to :mix, will actually attempt to merge field by field,
  # making sure that the field value of the winner(s) are used.
  #
  # ==== :isolate
  #
  # :isolate will rearrange the resulting workitem payload so that there is
  # a new field for each branch. The name of each field is the index of the
  # branch from '0' to ...
  #
  # ==== :stack
  #
  # :stack will stack the workitems coming back from the concurrence branches
  # in an array whose order is determined by the :merge attributes. The array
  # is placed in the 'stack' field of the resulting workitem.
  # Note that the :stack merge_type also creates a 'stack_attributes' field
  # and populates it with the expanded attributes of the concurrence.
  #
  # Thus
  #
  #   sequence do
  #     concurrence :merge => :highest, :merge_type => :stack do
  #       reviewer1
  #       reviewer2
  #     end
  #     editor
  #   end
  #
  # will see the 'editor' receive a workitem whose fields look like :
  #
  #   { 'stack' => [{ ... reviewer1 fields ... }, { ... reviewer2 fields ... }],
  #     'stack_attributes' => { 'merge'=> 'highest', 'merge_type' => 'stack' } }
  #
  # This could prove useful for participant having to deal with multiple merge
  # strategy results.
  #
  # ==== :union
  #
  # (Available from ruote 2.2.1)
  #
  # Will override atomic fields, concat arrays and merge hashes...
  #
  # The union of those two workitems
  #
  #   { 'a' => 0, 'b' => [ 'x', 'y' ], 'c' => { 'aa' => 'bb' }
  #   { 'a' => 1, 'b' => [ 'y', 'z' ], 'c' => { 'cc' => 'dd' }
  #
  # will be
  #
  #   { 'a' => 1,
  #     'b' => [ 'x', 'y', 'z' ],
  #     'c' => { 'aa' => 'bb', 'cc' => 'dd' } }
  #
  # Warning: duplicates in arrays present _before_ the merge will be removed
  # as well.
  #
  # ==== :concat
  #
  # (Available from ruote 2.2.1)
  #
  # Much like :union, but duplicates are not removed. Thus
  #
  #   { 'a' => 0, 'b' => [ 'x', 'y' ], 'c' => { 'aa' => 'bb' }
  #   { 'a' => 1, 'b' => [ 'y', 'z' ], 'c' => { 'cc' => 'dd' }
  #
  # will be
  #
  #   { 'a' => 1,
  #     'b' => [ 'x', 'y', 'y', 'z' ],
  #     'c' => { 'aa' => 'bb', 'cc' => 'dd' } }
  #
  # ==== :ignore
  #
  # (Available from ruote 2.2.1)
  #
  # A very simple merge type, the workitems given back by the branches are
  # simply discarded and the workitem as passed to the concurrence expression
  # is used to reply to the parent expression (of the concurrence expression).
  #
  #
  # === :over_if (and :over_unless)
  #
  # Like the :count attribute controls how many branches have to reply before
  # a concurrence ends, the :over attribute is used to specify a condition
  # upon which the concurrence will [prematurely] end.
  #
  #   concurrence :over_if => '${f:over}'
  #     alpha
  #     bravo
  #     charly
  #   end
  #
  # will end the concurrence as soon as one of the branches replies with a
  # workitem whose field 'over' is set to true. (the remaining branches will
  # get cancelled unless :remaining => :forget is set).
  #
  # :over_unless needs no explanation.
  #
