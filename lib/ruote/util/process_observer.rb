module Ruote

  # A base class for process observers, just to provide convenience. It
  # (heavily) sugar coats the Ruote::Observer and translate the messages into
  # actions. Each such action is provided with pre-distilled information
  # relevant for processes.
  #
  # == Example implementation
  #
  #   require 'ruote/util/process_observer'
  #
  #   class WebsocketSubscriber < Ruote::ProcessObserver
  #      # override initialize to warm-up a websocket client
  #      def initialize(context, options={})
  #        super
  #        @client = WebsocketClient.new()
  #      end
  #
  #      # tell the listeners that a new process launched
  #      def on_launch(wfid, info)
  #        @client.publish(
  #          "/process/launch",
  #          { :name       => info[:workitem].wf_name,
  #            :wfid       => wfid,
  #            :definition => info[:pdef],
  #          }
  #        )
  #      end
  #
  #      # tell the listeners that a new process ended
  #      def on_end(wfid)
  #        @client.publish("/process/#{wfid}", { :end => true })
  #      end
  #   end
  #
  #   # Bind the observer to the Ruote::Dashboard instance
  #   #
  #   dashboard.add_service('websocket_subscriber', WebsocketSubscriber)
  #
  # == Actions
  #
  # The ProcessObserver adheres closely to the message actions, it calls the
  # following methods:
  #
  # on_launch::            When a process or sub-process starts
  # on_terminated::        When a process ends
  # on_error_intercepted:: When an error was intercepted
  # on_cancel::            When a process or sub-process was canceled
  # on_dispatch::          When a participant is dispatched
  # on_receive::           Whenever a workitem is received
  #
  # And others, but if you are interested in those; you might be better of
  # using the more low-level Ruote::Observer
  #
  # == Arguments
  #
  # The methods are called with (wfid[, info])
  #
  # You can provide a method-signature like:
  #
  #   def on_launch(wfid, info)
  #   def on_launch(wfid)
  #
  # ProcessObserver also supports on_pre methods.  You can provide a
  # method-signature like:
  #
  #   def on_pre_launch(wfid, info)
  #   def on_pre_launch(wfid)
  #
  # If the ProcessObserver cannot call the method with the info, it tries
  # to call without info. The info contains a hash of key/value entries.
  #
  # === Info
  #
  # The following info is provided:
  #
  # :workitem::  The workitem, if available
  # :action::    The original name of the action
  # :child::     Boolean; This is an event of a child, or sub-flow
  # :error::     The intercepted error (only provided with
  #              #on_error_intercepted)
  # :pdef::      The (sub-)process definition (only provided with #on_launch)
  # :variables:: The process variables, if available
  # :flavour::   The flavour of canceling (only on_cancel)
  #
  #
  # == Error handling
  #
  # If anywhere in your implementation an action raises a StandardError,
  # it is caught by the ProcessObserver and silently ignored.
  #
