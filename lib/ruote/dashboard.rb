  # and to query about their status. There are also methods for fixing
  # issues with stalled processes or processes stuck in errors.

  # Ruote::ReceiverMixin (this Engine class has all the methods of a Receiver).

    # Ruote 2.3.0 introduced the ability to wait for an event given its name.
    # Here is a quick list of event names and a their description:
    #
    # * 'launch' - [sub]process launch
    # * 'terminated' - process terminated
    # * 'ceased' - orphan process terminated
    # * 'apply' - expression application
    # * 'reply' - expression reply
    # * 'dispatched' - emitted workitem towards participant
    # * 'receive' - received workitem from participant
    # * 'pause' - pause order
    # * 'resume' - pause order
    # * 'dispatch_cancel' - emitting a cancel order to a participant
    # * 'dispatch_pause' - emitting a pause order to a participant
    # * 'dispatch_resume' - emitting a resume order to a participant
    #
    # Names that are past participles are for notification events, while
    # plain verbs are for action events. Most of the time, a notitication
    # is emitted has the result of an action event, workers don't take any
    # action on them, but services that are listening to the ruote activity
    # might want to do something about them.
    #
    #
    # == ruote 2.3.0 and wait_for(hash)
    #
    # For more precise testing, wait_for accepts hashes, for example:
    #
    #   r = dashboard.wait_for('action' => 'apply', 'exp_name' => 'wait')
    #
    # will block until a wait expression is applied.
    #
    # If you know ruote msgs, you can pinpoint at will:
    #
    #   r = dashboard.wait_for(
    #     'action' => 'apply',
    #     'exp_name' => 'wait',
    #     'fei.wfid' => wfid)
    #
    # == what wait_for returns
    #
    # #wait_for returns the intercepted event. It's useful when testing/
    # spec'ing, as in:
    #
    #   it 'completes successfully' do
    #
    #     definition = Ruote.define :on_error => 'charly' do
    #       alpha

    #

    #     r['workitem']['fields']['charly'].should == nil
    #   end
    #
    # == :timeout option
    #
    # One can pass a timeout value in seconds for the #wait_for call, as in:
    #
    #   dashboard.wait_for(wfid, :timeout => 5 * 60)
    #
    # The default timeout is 60 (seconds). A nil or negative timeout disables
    # the timeout.

    #   A Hash of keys pointing to arrays of expected values.
