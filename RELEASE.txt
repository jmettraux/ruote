== What's new

The main driving force between this release and the previous has been the work on ruote-rest (the Rack / REST based web application wrapper around ruote).

There have been many bugfixes as well as simplifications. One of the most obvious simplifications : the ruote-extras gem vanished, everything goes into one unique 'ruote' gem.

On the web front, note that ruote-fluo, the javascript library used for drawing process definitions on the fly (used by ruote-rest and ruote-web) is currently usable with Firefox 3 only. I hope that the webkit based browsers will implement canvas text drawing soon.

Ruote-fluo first task is to render process definition graphically, on the fly. Lately, it was enhanced as a process designer as well [1]. It's currently rather alpha, but promising.

A DbHistory has been implemented (and integrated into ruote-rest). It tracks activity in the workflow engine and is easily queriable. Ruote-rest provides an atom feed representation for it.


The next release will probably focus on ruote-web2, a rewrite of ruote-web (the Rails based workflow environment). Ruote-fluo will be improved as well, with a focus on helping the user in its process-design task.


Many thanks to all that have contributed patches, suggested ideas and provided feedback.
